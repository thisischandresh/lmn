i was 21 and she was 29 <br>
and then i was 29 and she was 21 <br>
i was wrong before, i was wrong again <br>
touch, see, talk <br>
eat, drink, walk <br>
travelled far from where i made home <br>
to where it could never be home <br>
a few days <br>
and a lot of years <br>
i stopped then <br>
i stopped now <br>
i felt alone, i was alone <br>
i didn’t realise there is no one who could be home <br>
i will be okay, i will try to be okay <br>
i will not be okay, i will be honest <br>
i was wrong before, i was wrong again <br>
smile, text, hope <br>
cry, forget, cope <br>
learned to take care of myself <br>
and how to take care of her <br>
some patience <br>
and a lot of mistakes <br>
i lost myself then <br>
i lost myself now <br>
i felt scared, i was scared <br>
i didn’t realise i could know fear like this <br>
i will breathe okay, i will try to breathe okay <br>
i will lose my breath, i will be dead <br>
i was wrong again
