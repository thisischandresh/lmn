I was 21 and she was 29 <br>
And then I was 29 and she was 21 <br>
I was wrong before, I was wrong again <br>
Touch, see, talk <br>
Eat, drink, walk <br>
Travelled far from where I made home <br>
To where it could never be home <br>
A few days <br>
And a lot of years <br>
I stopped then <br>
I stopped now <br>
I felt alone, I was alone <br>
I didn’t realise there is no one who could be home <br>
I will be okay, I will try to be okay <br>
I will not be okay, I will be honest <br>
I was wrong before, I was wrong again <br>
Smile, text, hope <br>
Cry, forget, cope <br>
Learned to take care of myself <br>
And how to take care of her <br>
Some patience <br>
And many mistakes <br>
I lost myself then <br>
I lost myself now <br>
I felt scared, I was scared <br>
I didn’t realise I could know fear like this <br>
I will breathe okay, I will try to breathe okay <br>
I will lose my breath, I will be dead <br>
I was wrong again
