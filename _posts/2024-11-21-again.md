i was 21 and she was 29 and then i was 29 and she was 21
i was wrong before, i was wrong again
touch, see, talk
eat, drink, walk
travelled far from where i made home
to where it could never be home
a few days
and a lot of years
i stopped then
i stopped now
i felt alone, i was alone
i didn’t realise there is no one who could be home
i will be okay, i will try to be okay
i will not be okay, i will be honest
i was wrong before, i was wrong again
smile, text, hope
cry, forget, cope
learned to take care of myself
and also how to take care of her
some patience
and a lot of mistakes
i lost myself then
i lost myself now
i felt scared, i was scared
i didn’t realise i could know fear like this
i will breathe okay, i will try to breathe okay
i will lose my breath, i will be dead
i was wrong again
