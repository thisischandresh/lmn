There’s a boy who travels in a train <br/>
Which takes 40 minutes to college <br/>
So he has his headphones on <br/>
And he reads <br/>
He reads while travelling <br/>
And he travels to read <br/>
He reads while coming home <br/>
While going to a new city <br/>
While taking a light <br/>
When travelling alone <br/>
In a cafe while having breakfast <br/>
At the beach waiting for sunset <br/>
At the park, at the lake <br/>
He can talk to people instead <br/>
And he reads anyway

There’s a boy who learns the business <br/>
At a startup which is also his first job <br/>
He learns PR, marketing, event management <br/>
And googles what is a Product Manager <br/>
He learns branding at an agency <br/>
Which pays him 28,000 per month <br/>
He learns to work with people <br/>
And that its difficult to work with people <br/>
Who gets into trouble every week <br/>
Who fakes it till he makes it <br/>
Who finds the people he loves working with <br/>
People who are friends <br/>
People to eat with, to dance with <br/>
To laugh, to fight, to walk with <br/>
He can continue doing all of this <br/>
And he doesn’t anyway

There’s a boy who makes time to eat <br/>
Sometimes a sandwich, a pasta <br/>
Sometimes he walks after seven to the place <br/>
Where he can get a samosa and a vada pav <br/>
A treats means taking the rickshaw back <br/>
And also ordering a dessert <br/>
He eats with time and comfort <br/>
And then takes a stroll in the neighbourhood <br/>
He discovers a small diary <br/>
Black cover, blank pages <br/>
Spiral binding on top side <br/>
And only a few of them <br/>
He buys them once, twice <br/>
And until the stock isn’t there <br/>
He can buy a different diary <br/>
He doesn't anyway

There’s a boy who has a home <br/>
With plants, books, a kitchen <br/>
Filled with all the important things <br/>
Windows, curtains, a mirror <br/>
A nice bed, and an average sofa <br/>
There are trees, there’s a terrace <br/>
There is a sea, and a shoe rack <br/>
Enough time to cook, to sleep <br/>
To make chai, to excel at work <br/>
To live here more <br/>
And he leaves anyway

There’s a boy who leaves <br/>
The town he grew up in <br/>
The place he shared with flatmates <br/>
The trains he travelled in <br/>
The cafes he liked to have coffee at <br/>
The short stories he wrote <br/>
The certificates he earned <br/>
The school, the college <br/>
The cabs that go nowhere <br/>
The road where moon shines the brightest
 
There’s a boy who leaves <br/>
His parents, his sibling, his cousins <br/>
His nieces who are full of energy and chaos <br/>
His friends with whom he had <br/>
His first beer and first cigarette <br/>
His friends with whom he learned to play football <br/>
His girlfriend when she had suicidal thoughts <br/>
His friends with whom he first went to a club <br/>
His friends with whom he smoked his last cigarette <br/>
His girlfriend again when she left her job <br/>
His friends with whom he cooked <br/>
His friends whose contacts he memorised <br/>
His idea about the things he likes <br/>
His idea about the relationships he wants <br/>
His expectations, his beliefs <br/>
His version of who he is, who he has to be <br/>

There’s a boy who can stay <br/>
And leaves anyway

There’s a boy who goes into the sea <br/>
And thinks he is the sea
